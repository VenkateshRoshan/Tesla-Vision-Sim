# Tesla-Vision-Sim
A real-time simulation system that converts vehicle camera feed into a 3D Blender environment. Uses YOLOv9 for object detection, DeepSORT for tracking, and custom lane detection. The system processes video frames, identifies vehicles, pedestrians, and road features, then generates a corresponding 3D scene in Blender for visualization.
